This project demonstrates the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a SQLite database using the sqlite3 library in Python. These operations are essential for managing and manipulating data in databases. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what each operation entails and how they are implemented in this project:

Create Operation: This involves creating new records in a database. In our Project, we create a books table if it doesn't already exist and then add multiple book entries to this table. Each book record includes a title, author, and year of publication.

Read Operation: This operation retrieves and displays records from a database. In our project, we read and print all book entries from the books table to show the current state of the database.

Update Operation: This modifies existing records in the database. Although not explicitly demonstrated in the final code snippet, the update_book function is designed to change the details of a book identified by its ID.

Delete Operation: This removes records from the database. Similar to the update operation, the delete_book function, though not shown in the final execution, is available to delete a book entry by its ID.
